> An opinionated generator for using npm based development tools with any language.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-dev-standards using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-dev-standards
```

Clone the repo and link it:

Finally, move to a fresh directory with git setup (preferably with a remote added) and initiate the generator:

```bash
yo dev-standards
```

## What this Generator Controls

### Git Hooks

Git hooks are auto-configured using husky and lint-staged. Out of the box, it includes the following hooks:

#### Pre-Commit

Precommit hooks are setup to the following:
* eslint for all .js files
* jsonlint for all .json files
* pylint for all .py files
* rubocop for all .rb files

#### Commit Message

Validates using Commitlint to commitizen standard for compatibility with standard-version auto-generated changelogs and version bumps.

### Release Process

To release a new version, simply run:

```bash
npm run release
```

This will automatically increment the version in package.json and the version file according to the commit history, and create a tag. It will also auto-update the changelog.

### Standards

To re-run the dev-standards generator:

```
npm run standards
```
